<h4>What This is, And What it isn't</h4>
<p>
	This project is simply a way for me to learn native Android development. <em>However</em>, once it is completed I may add it to the Android Market so others can benefit from its functionality (as long as it turns out fairly well).
</p>

<h4>What are the the <em>Cool</em> Parts?</h4>
<p>
	The major focus here is working with RESTful API's, integrating with Google Books, and creating a new way to read textual information when using a potentially small touch-screen device.
</p>	

<h4>Where's the <em>Beef</em>?</h4>
<p>
	There are a lot of frameworks and various tools available to make many of the things being done in this app significantly easier. However, since the primary goal in this is learning, I will take advantage of every opportunity to gain a better understanding of the OS and Java along the way (even if it means it could be harder than it has to be).
</p>
<p>
	Please contact me if you would be interested in getting involved in any way. I plan on documenting this process in order to develop an entire [blog series](http://dwhoffman.wordpress.com) out of the idea of a C# .NET developer learning native Android development (crazy, huh?), and I could use any help that may be available.
