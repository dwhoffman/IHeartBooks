What This Is
------------
This project is simply a way for me to learn native Android development. *However*, once it is completed I may add it to the Android Market so others can (hopefully) benefit from its functionality.

What's Being Used
-----------------
The major focus here is working with RESTful API's, integrating with Google Books, and creating a new way to read textual information when using a potentially small touch-screen device.

Why So Few Frameworks
---------------------
There are a lot of frameworks and various tools available to make many of the things being done in this app significantly easier. However, since the primary goal in this is learning, I will take advantage of every opportunity to gain a better understanding of the OS and Java along the way (even if it means it could be harder than it has to be).

__Please contact me if you would be interested in getting involved in any way. I plan on documenting this process in order to develop an entire [blog series](http://dwhoffman.wordpress.com) out of the idea of a C# .NET developer learning native Android development (crazy, huh?), and I could use any help that may be available.__
